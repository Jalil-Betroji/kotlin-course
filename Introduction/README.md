# Introduction

Kotlin is a modern, statically-typed programming language developed by JetBrains. Launched in 2011, Kotlin has rapidly gained popularity among developers for its concise syntax, interoperability with existing Java codebases, and robust features such as null safety, extension functions, and coroutines for asynchronous programming. With its seamless integration into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Android platform, and support for multi-platform development, Kotlin has become a versatile choice for building a wide range of applications, from mobile apps to backend services and beyond.

# What You Will See in This Course

In this course, I will cover everything that you need to know in order to be able to create other programs or move to building apps on Android. I will start from scratch by downloading the necessary software to run code, then proceed to creating our first program, and finally, we'll move on to more advanced topics. We'll cover things like variables, operators, loops, arrays, object-oriented programming, generics, lambda functions, and coroutines. Everything will be covered in depth with great detail.
